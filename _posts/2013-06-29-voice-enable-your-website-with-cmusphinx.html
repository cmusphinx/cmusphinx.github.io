<p>It has been a long dream to voice-enable websites. However, no good technology existed for this either because speech recognition on the web required a connection to a server or due to the requirement to install binary plugin.</p>
<p>Great news is that you can now use CMUSphinx in any modern browser completely on the client side. No need for installation, no need to maintain voice recognition server farm. This is a really cool technology.</p>
<p>Sylvain Chevalier has been working on a port of Pocketsphinx to JavaScript using emscripten. Combined with the Web Audio API, it works great as a real-time recognizer for web applications, running entirely in the browser, without plug-in.</p>
<p>It's on Github (<a href="https://github.com/syl22-00/pocketsphinx.js">https://github.com/syl22-00/pocketsphinx.js</a>),<br />
comments, suggestions and contributions are more than welcome!</p>
