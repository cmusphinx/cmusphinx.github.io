<p>It is an old idea to implement an open source dictation tool everyone could use. Without servers, networking, without the need to share your private speech with someone else. This is certainly not a trivial project which was started many times, but it's something really world-changing. Now, it's live again, powered by CMUSphinx.</p>
<p>Consider details <a href="http://grasch.net/node/22">about ongoing efforts of Simon project</a> to implement open source dictation.</p>
