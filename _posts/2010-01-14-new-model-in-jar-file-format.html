<p>The latest version of Sphinx4 has a new and improved model system.</p>
<p>Now all acoustic and language models are loaded as normal files in directories.<br />
File paths are specified as URIs and therefore may exist anywhere on the Internet.<br />
In addition, for convenience, "resource:" causes Sphinx4 to look on the classpath<br />
for a file.</p>
<p>Special Models and ModelLoaders are no longer required, and resource specifiers<br />
no longer require the clumsy resource:<class>!/
<path> syntax.</p>
<p>Kudos to Peter</p>
