<p>Please consider Sphinx4-based spoken dialog system toolkit demonstration <a href="http://www.okkoblog.com/2010/11/04/inprotk-demonstration/">http://www.okkoblog.com/2010/11/04/inprotk-demonstration/ </a> by University of Potsdam and the Inpro Group. Few interesting improvements to the core are there such as prosody-driven end-of-turn classification, mid-utterance action execution and display of partial ASR hypotheses </p>
