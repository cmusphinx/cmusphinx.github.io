<p>Brian King wrote a blog post on getting pocket sphinx up and running on iPhone a while back and got a few emails last week asking for help.&nbsp; He was so amazing so he cleaned up the code and made a little library for it:</p>
<p><a href="http://github.com/KingOfBrian/VocalKit">http://github.com/KingOfBrian/VocalKit</a></p>
<p>This should give you a library that statically links the sphinix libraries and a simple API that connects to Audio Queue.&nbsp; It also comes with a test program so you should be able to have a demo up and working very quickly inside of XCode.</p>
<p>The plans are to add to the API to support dynamic language model creation, but the main goal is to get people up and running as soon as possible.&nbsp; He would appreciate any feedback!</p>
