**Executive Summary: Try the new Python module (please).**

Hot on the heels of the last one, there is another [release
candidate](https://github.com/cmusphinx/pocketsphinx/releases/tag/v5.0.0rc3).
You can also download it [from
PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/pocketsphinx/).

There isn't much to announce except that the `pocketsphinx5` Python
package doesn't exist anymore.  That's right, the Python interface is
now called just plain `pocketsphinx`.  It should install properly on
Windows and Mac OS X now, as well.

Pull requests and bug reports and such are welcome via
[GitHub](https://github.com/cmusphinx/pocketsphinx).
