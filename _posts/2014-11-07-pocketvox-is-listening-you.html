<p>We are pleased to announce a release of Pocketvox, a voice control project for Linux desktop.</p>
<p><strong>What is Pocketvox ?</strong></p>
<p>Pocketvox is a desktop application and a development library written in C and created by Benoit Franquet, a french newly graduated engineer, visually impaired and passionated by desktop accessibility and application development.</p>
<p>Pocketvox is based on several well known open source libraries such as Sphinxbase, Pocketsphinx, GStreamer, GLib-2.0, GObject-2.0, Gtk+, ... from the <a href="http://gnome.org">GNOME</a> project, Espeak to make Pocketvox respond with voice and Xlib to detect the focused window.</p>
<p>Pocketvox comes with several tools in order to make both developers and desktop users able to create or use voice controlled applications.</p>

<p><strong>Pocketvox for desktop users</strong></p>
<p>For the desktop, Pocketvox comes with:</p>
<p>- A menu launcher to launch the pocketvox application<br />
- A panel applet to manage Pocketvox<br />
- A configuration GUI and its launcher in the menu<br />
- A common way to store the configuration using GSettinsgs<br />
- A way to choose the micro input<br />
- A way to send commands over TCP<br />
- An activation keyword in order to start actions when you say a specific word<br />
- A very flexible way to manage modules</p>
<p><strong>Pocketvox for developers</strong></p>
<p>For developers, Pocketvox provides:</p>
<p>- A .pc file to develop with Pocketvox<br />
- A Python interface<br />
- A very easy way to design your own module in Python</p>
<p>Python interface has been built using the GObject introspection, a very basic example is available on the Github page of the project.</p>
<p><strong>Some addons Pocketvox comes with</strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong>Pocketvox has been build in order to use a system of module. Why ?  Because, this allow desktop users to define and create very rapidly new modules only by writing a dictionnary file with a very simple structure like this:</p>
<p>open my documents=xdg-open ~/Documents<br />
open my images=xdg-open ~/Images</p>
<p>Moreover, thanks to this structure users are able to associate a specific application to a module. When pocketvox is running then it will detect the focused application and execute commands listed in the module's dictionnary file.</p>
<p>Besides somes bash scripts have been integrated to the Pocketvox project in order to make users able to rapidly create a custom language model using the cmuclmtk toolkit.</p>
<p>Pocketvox is working out of the box using language models, acoustic models and dictionaries available on our website.</p>
<p>Pocketvox is ready for translation and already available in French and English.&nbsp;All steps to translate it are available on the Pocketvox repository on Github. Pocketvox is waiting for you to make it available in other language.</p>
