<p>There is a big demand in support of speech recognition API in various programming environments. Python is getting a lot of traction, Ruby is still widely used among ROR developers, then Javascript is getting more importance, even among non-web programmers.  Surprisingly, Node is quite popular in robotics and embedded development these days. Then there is Java on servers and Java on Android, C# on Windows mobile and desktop, C# in mono and Unity3d, a wide-spread game platform. Then there is GStreamer multimedia framework, also quite popular due to support for various complex media processing pipelines. Last, Microsoft somehow decided to forget C# and recently invented Managed C++ for Windows Phone. Hopefully, they will forget about that beast soon.</p>
<p>It might be reasonable to create a specific wrapper for every case, and there are many ways to write wrappers. For example in Python you can use FFI, cython and few other technologies. But you need to take into account that wrapper is not simply a piece code to invoke methods. Language support goes with documentation on how to use the decoder in particular language, tests, performance evaluations and so on and so forth. It is very complex to maintain even simple bindings for the language, imagine if you need to support 10 of them. There are example of custom wrappers created for CMUSphinx, <a href="https://github.com/watsonbox/pocketsphinx-ruby">Pocketsphinx-Ruby</a> based on FFI or <a href="https://github.com/moneppo/node-pocketsphinx">Node wrapper for Pocketsphinx</a>. Looking on those efforts you can see that while extremely useful, such frameworks are significantly inconsistent, making it harder to reuse C documentation and C examples, thus increasing maintenance effort to support them all.</p>
<p>There are very good solutions for this problem, one of them is <a href="http://swig.org">SWIG</a>, a wrapper generator with special API description language. With SWIG one can easily create interfaces in dozen languages and access all pocketsphinx features in a consistent way.</p>
<p>Recently we have implemented a support for SWIG wrappers for several languages like Ruby and Node Javascript. We also supported Python and Java bindings in SWIG for quite some time. As a result, you can get consistent native language interface in many languages:</p>
<p>For example, here is Ruby code:</p>
<pre>
require 'pocketsphinx'
config = Pocketsphinx::Decoder.default_config()
config.set_string('-hmm', '../../model/en-us/en-us')
config.set_string('-dict', '../../model/en-us/cmudict-en-us.dict')
config.set_string('-lm', '../../model/en-us/en-us.lm.bin')
decoder = Pocketsphinx::Decoder.new(config)
decoder.start_utt()
open("../../test/data/goforward.raw") {|f|
    while record = f.read(4096)
         decoder.process_raw(record, false, false)
    end
}
decoder.end_utt()
puts decoder.hyp().hypstr()
decoder.seg().each { |seg|
      puts "#{seg.word} #{seg.start_frame} #{seg.end_frame}"
}
</pre>
<p>And here is Javascript code</p>
<pre>
var fs = require('fs');
var ps = require('pocketsphinx').ps;
modeldir = "../../model/en-us/"
var config = new ps.Decoder.defaultConfig();
config.setString("-hmm", modeldir + "en-us");
config.setString("-dict", modeldir + "cmudict-en-us.dict");
config.setString("-lm", modeldir + "en-us.lm.bin");
var decoder = new ps.Decoder(config);
fs.readFile("../../test/data/goforward.raw", function(err, data) {
     if (err) throw err;
     decoder.startUtt();
     decoder.processRaw(data, false, false);
     decoder.endUtt();
     console.log(decoder.hyp())
     it = decoder.seg().iter()
     while ((seg = it.next()) != null) {
           console.log(seg.word, seg.startFrame, seg.endFrame);
     }
});
</pre>
<p>Here is Python code:</p>
<pre>
from pocketsphinx.pocketsphinx import *
from sphinxbase.sphinxbase import *
modeldir = "../../../model"
config = Decoder.default_config()
config.set_string('-hmm', path.join(modeldir, 'en-us/en-us'))
config.set_string('-lm', path.join(modeldir, 'en-us/en-us.lm.bin'))
config.set_string('-dict', path.join(modeldir, 'en-us/cmudict-en-us.dict'))
decoder = Decoder(config)
decoder.start_utt()
stream = open(path.join("../../../test/data", 'goforward.raw'), 'rb')
while True:
  buf = stream.read(4096)
  if buf:
    decoder.process_raw(buf, False, False)
  else:
    break
decoder.end_utt()
hypothesis = decoder.hyp()
print ('Best hypothesis: ', hypothesis.hypstr, " model score: ", hypothesis.best_score, " confidence: ", hypothesis.prob)
print ('Best hypothesis segments: ', [seg.word for seg in decoder.seg()])
</pre>
<p>There are two issues in using this technology. First, SWIG is not always easy for newcomers, the syntax is complex and not always easy to comprehend, however, the whole framework is extremely flexible and enables to implement very complex features like iterators. So additional effort to learn SWIG is definitely justified and we have quite some experience now, so we can help anyone interested to add support for a new language.</p>
<p>Second issue is that it is not always easy to support many language features, async interfaces of Node require a lot of additional work on top of C API. However, such API must be implemented as an extension of SWIG-created interface, making it easy to keep consistent API across languages and frameworks and allowing us to improve C API as well. This is the approach we took with Java on Android, I believe this approach could be successful for other languages.</p>
<p>A separate project <a href="http://github.com/cmusphinx/node-pocketsphinx">node-pocketsphinx</a> which enables simple installation of Node wrapper with npm package manager is a tiny layer above SWIG-created wrapper. You only need to provide package files and you can enjoy full decoder features of <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/pocketsphinx">NPM Pocketsphinx</a> module. It still misses async API which is important for Node, but we hope to add it soon.</p>
<p>Large varieties of use cases we meet with shared language wrappers are very helpful for C API design as it pointed above. For example, we recently changed word segment iterator C API to provide better consistency across different languages and simplified access. Hopefully, such activity will enable us to create a good stable C API for the upcoming release of CMUSphinx framework version 5.</p>
