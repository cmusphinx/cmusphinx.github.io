<p>With the launch of Android Wear's new version 2.0 now it is possible
to run standalone apps on wearables - indepentent of a phone.</p>

<p>The <a
href="https://github.com/cmusphinx/pocketsphinx-android-demo">PocketSphinx
Demo</a> app for Android includes continuous listening for the keyphrase
&ldquo;oh mighty computer&rdquo; and once that keyphrase has been
recognized, it switches to grammar mode to let you input some
information. And now, thanks to the contribution of <a
href="https://github.com/mahula">Mathias Lenz</a>, the demo app has been
extended by a module to make it available as a standalone app on
wearables running Android Wear 2.0.</p>

<p>To explore the source code and test and run it, you can just download
the project from our GitHub, import it to your Android Studio, run it in
an emulator and build an APK and deploy it onto a wearable
device&nbsp;running Android Wear 2.0. Let us know how it works.</p>
