<p><a href="http://sonalight.com/">Sonalight</a>, which showed off its  product at this week&rsquo;s Y Combinator Demo Day, thinks voice tech is  better put to use tackling real issues users&nbsp;have&nbsp;with their mobiles in  everyday settings, like texting while driving. Sonalight&nbsp;actually employs Google&rsquo;s own existing voice recognition tech,  in combination with&nbsp;the&nbsp;CMU Sphinx open source software, to achieve its  results. This is a great use case for CMUSphinx.</p>
