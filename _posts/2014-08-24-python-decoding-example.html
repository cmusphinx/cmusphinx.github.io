<p>Python programming language is getting amazing popularity recently due to the elegance of the language, wide range of tools for scientific computing including scipy and NLTK and the immediacy of a "scripting" style language. We often get request to explain how to decode with pocketsphinx and Python.</p>
<p>Another <a href="http://www.voxforge.org/home/forums/other-languages/german/updated-german-sphinx-model-up-to-21k-words-now">interesting activity</a> going around CMUSphinx is an updated acoustic model for German language. A frequent updates are posted on Voxforge website by Guenter, please check his new very much improved German models here: <a href="http://goofy.zamia.org/voxforge/de/">http://goofy.zamia.org/voxforge/de/</a>. With the new improvements like audio aligner tool you can build a very accurate model for almost any language in a week or so.</p>
<p>To summarize these new features, one of our users, Matthias provided a nice tutorial on how to start with Pocketsphinx and Python and German models. With the new SWIG-based API we increased support for decoder features available in Python, now you can do from Python almost the same things you can do from C.
