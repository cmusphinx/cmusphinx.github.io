<p>After several years break we are pleased to announce that CMUSphinx project is accepted to Google Summer Of Code 2017 program. That will enable us to help several students to start their way in speech recognition, open source development and in CMUSphinx. We are really excited about that. See the <a href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/organizations/6234667528224768/">organization page</a> for details.</p>
<p>This year will be more focused on pronunciation evaluation, two major pronunciation tasks will be our preference. If you are interested to participate as a student, an application period will open soon but it&rsquo;s better to start preparation of your application right now. Feel free to contact us for any questions, but do your own googling before asking very simple things! For more details see:</p>
