<p><strong>Foreword</strong></p>
<p>As part of the PostProcessing Framework task of capitalization and punctuation recovery I am using Finite State Automata (FSA) to model hyperstrings ( all written forms of a text) and Language Models. These will be composed and a best-path search in the resulting FSA will output the best version (capitalized and punctuated) of a string.</p>
<p><strong>Hyperstring FSA</strong></p>
<p>The hyperstring FSA is composed from a string (i.e. "This is exciting") and considers all the possible written forms of the string.</p>
<blockquote><p>S0 --- (This, this, THIS) ---> T0 --- (<COMMA>, <PERIOD>, <NONE>) ---> S1 --- (Is, is, IS) ---> T1 --- (<COMMA>, <PERIOD>, <NONE>) ---> S2 --- (Exciting, exciting, EXCITING) ---> T2 --- (<COMMA>, <PERIOD>, <NONE>) ---> S3</p></blockquote>

<p>S0 is the start state and S3 is the final state. Transitions between Si and Ti contain words and transitions between Ti and Ti+1 contain punctuation marks.</p>
<p>In the project this is represented by the FSA object which is constructed with the String we want to model and a boolean value which states if we also want punctuation added between transitions. If not the FSA will look like this:</p>
<blockquote><p>S0 --- (This, this, THIS) ---> S1 --- (Is, is, IS) ---> S2 --- (Exciting, exciting, EXCITING) ---> S3</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Language Model FSA</strong></p>
<p>The language model FSA encodes a language model into a FSA structure. Two states are default for every LM FSA: start and eps states. Transitions from a state to another contain a word and the probability of the destination state ngram. Transitions from a state to the eps state contain the backoff probability of that ngram.</p>
<p>When initialized, the LanguageModelFSA object takes as parameters URL objects which contain the location of the language model, a dictionary and a filler dictionary. In this class I have used the sphinx4 library to read the language model. When created, the object outputs three files: a file which contains the fsa (lm_fsa), the input symbols table (lm_fsa_isyms) which is the same as the output symbols table (in case we want to consider a FST) and the state symbols table (lm_fsa_ssyms). If needed the output can be compiled with openfst and printed.</p>

<p>To download the code: svn co https://cmusphinx.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/cmusphinx/branches/ppf</p>
<p>Compile with make and run program with scripts/createfsa.sh with the string you want to model into a FSA, the path to the LM, dictionary and filler dictionary as parameters.</p>
