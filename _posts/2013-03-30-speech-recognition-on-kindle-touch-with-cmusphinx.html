<p>We are happy to announce that CMUSphinx-powered speech recognition comes to Amazon Kindle. "Vague" or Voice Activated GUi Extension was recently introduced and <a href="http://kual.knetconnect.com/vague-voice-activated-gui-for-kual/">already available for your Kindle</a> with Kual, a unified launcher</p>
<p>If you have an old Kindle sitting around, or you just want to get a little more out of the one use every day, jailbreaking is simple. Once you jailbreak, KUAL is a worthwhile little application launcher that gives you easy access to what you download.</p>
<p>KUAL works with pretty much every single Kindle model. Once it's installed, you can run the program, and you're given a simple, easy to use launcher to access everything on your Kindle. That means games, VNC clients, apps, and plenty more. It's a nifty little launcher, and the fact it works on pretty much every Kindle out there makes it simple to use.</p>
<p>Vague allows you to navigate through your bookreader, launch various tools and, more importantly, it's highly extensible in mind. That means that you can add your own commands easily with just a simple script!</p>
<p>Great job done!</p>

<p>CMUSphinx is a great choice if you want to add recognition to your mobile or embedded device. If you are interested in help, please join #cmusphinx irc channel on Freenode.net, we would be glad to help you to configure and run it.</p>
