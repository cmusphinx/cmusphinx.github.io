<p>Over the years CMUSphinx become more and more popular. You probably would be interested to know that all last three month CMUSphinx gets into 25 most active projects on SourceForge. And that's not suprising.</p>
<p>A set of new interesting projects are started nowdays using CMUSphinx, to mention a few for example there is <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/vedics/">Vedics</a>, a desktop control system or <a href="http://www.opencastproject.org/">OpenCast</a> project, an e-learning platorm. Others are <a href="https://cmusphinx.github.io/wiki/sphinxinaction">listed</a> in our wiki.</p>
<p>But we certainly need more. If you've done your term project with CMUSphinx, don't stop on that. Develop a new featured application!</p>
