<p>We applied for Google SoC programm 2010 but were rejected. Anyway we appreciate Google's contribution to open souce development. We wish all accepted projects to successfully finish the program this year and we wish good luck to all the students who will participate.</p>
<p>As for us, we still have a lot of tasks that every newbie could put hands on</p>

<p>We would be glad to guide anyone who wants to start with them. If you are a student and want to learn more about speech recognition, it's your chance to jump in. We are also open for sponsorship suggestions for this task.</p>
