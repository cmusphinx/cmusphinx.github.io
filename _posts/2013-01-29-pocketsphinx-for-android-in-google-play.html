<p>Pocketsphinx is a great alternative to a closed-source vendor SDK's due to it's open source nature, extensibility and features. If you are looking to impelment a speech application on Android, feel free to try Pocketsphinx. To get started, you can use existing applications like <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ee.ioc.phon.android.inimesed">Inimesed</a></p>
<p>It's a great application to select contacts, you can install it on your device with a single click.</p>
<p>The sources and related things are available on the <a href="http://kaljurand.github.com/Inimesed/">Github</a>. Many thanks to Kaarel Kaljurand for his great software!</p>
