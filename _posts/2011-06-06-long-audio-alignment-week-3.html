<p>Last update indicated an error rate of almost 16 % for sufficiently large audio files. Experiments were conducted to pin-point the source of these errors.&nbsp; It was then suggested to align audio without classifying speech and non-speech components of the audio.&nbsp; Alignment with such configuration is now being tested with different grammars for different sorts of possible errors in the audio and/or transcription.</p>
<p>Audio and it's perfect transcription for up to 20 minutes long utterances have been checked for alignment with the current state of aligner, and the resulted in close 0% word error rate. The grammar used for this sort of&nbsp; alignment only allows transitions from word to it's immediate successor in the transcription.</p>
<p>We are currently classifying different sorts of errors in transcription and utterance , and modelling grammar to allow alignment for the same.</p>
