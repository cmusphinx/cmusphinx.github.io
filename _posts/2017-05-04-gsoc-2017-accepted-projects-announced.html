<p>The list of accepted projects for Google Summer of Code 2017 has been<a href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/organizations/6234667528224768/"> announced today</a>. Please check</p>
<p>There are two major parts, one is pronunciation evaluation, we have several sub-projects about it, another part is about deep neural networks in pocketsphinx. Hopefully, the accuracy of our decoders will improve significantly. An interesting project is dedicated to more tight ROS integration, hopefully using speech recognition in robots will be way easier soon.</p>
<p>Congratulations to accepted students! Great summer ahead, lots of fun it seems.</p>
