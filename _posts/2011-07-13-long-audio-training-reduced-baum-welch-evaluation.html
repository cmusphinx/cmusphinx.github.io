<p>In the last post regarding the <strong>Long Audio Training</strong> it was<img class="alignright" src="https://cmusphinx.github.io/wiki/_media/wiki:long-training:modules-rita.png" alt="" width="300" height="186" /> indicated that there were still some problems in the reduced Baum-Welch implementation. Fortunately these were identified as memory leaks introduced during the optimization and were fixed. In the past days I have made some extensive tests, which show, that modified algorithms perform significantly better than the original version of SphinxTrain with the respect to the memory consumption.</p>
<p>See <a href="https://cmusphinx.github.io/wiki/longaudiotraining">https://cmusphinx.github.io/wiki/longaudiotraining</a> for more detailed evaluation.</p>
