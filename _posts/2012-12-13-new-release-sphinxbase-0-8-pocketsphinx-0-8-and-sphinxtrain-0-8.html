<p>We are pleased to announce that today a pack of CMUSphinx packages was&nbsp;released:</p>
<ul>
<li>sphinxbase-0.8</li>
<li>pocketsphinx-0.8</li>
<li>sphinxtrain-0.8</li>
</ul>
<p>For the download links see:</p>

</a></p>
<p>The biggest update of this release is a new sphinxtrain. The code&nbsp;sharing between sphinxbase and sphinxtrain significantly increased&nbsp;bringing more consistent codebase and interface, accurate memory&nbsp;management and increased usability.</p>
<p>Beside that, a single sphinxtrain binary is introduced to provide an&nbsp;easy and flexible access to the whole training procedure. In the future&nbsp;we hope to reduce the amount of Perl scripts in training setup and to&nbsp;port everything on Python. This will open the access to an advanced&nbsp;Python ecosystem including scientific packages, graphics and distributed&nbsp;computing.</p>
<p>Another notable change of this release in a new openfst-based G2P&nbsp;framework implemented during Google Summer of Code. Credits for this&nbsp;should go to Josef Robert Novak and John Salatas. This framework is also&nbsp;supported by sphinx4 and provides a uniform and accurate algorithm to create&nbsp;dictionaries from word lists.</p>
<p>A numerous bug fixes and improvements were submitted by our contributors. We should be&nbsp;grateful to the great developers who made this release possible. Many thanks&nbsp;to our star team, which is impressively long:</p>
