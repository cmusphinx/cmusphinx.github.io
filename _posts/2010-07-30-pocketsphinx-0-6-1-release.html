<p>This is a bugfix release, addressing a number of important issues in the 0.6 release.  Specifically:</p>
<ul>
<li> The GStreamer plugin was broken with old versions of GStreamer (such as the one shipped on Nokia Internet Tablets) which did not accept "BSD" as a valid license type.</li>
<li>Runtime performance of the statistical LM based decoder was significantly worse than 0.5 when not using phoneme lookahead.&nbsp; It is now about 10% faster and also uses less memory.</li>
<li>The FSG decoder now consumes drastically less memory and CPU power.&nbsp; (It is still not as good as it should be, but no longer completely embarrassing)</li>
<li>The Python modules were undocumented.&nbsp; Docstrings compatible with epydoc have been added.</li>
<li>Raw audio logging (-rawlogdir) was broken.</li>
<li>Adding new words works properly, including words with unknown triphones (which never worked before).</li>
<li>The SphinxBase Python module can now use class-based language models.</li>
<li>The pitch estimation utility (sphinx_pitch) now builds properly on Win32.</li>
<li>Some problems with the N-Gram iterator API have been fixed.</li>
<li>Bestpath search has been fixed to handle recognition failure gracefully.</li>
</ul>
<p>Source code is available for download on SourceForge.&nbsp; Binary packages for Ubuntu will be updated shortly.</p>
