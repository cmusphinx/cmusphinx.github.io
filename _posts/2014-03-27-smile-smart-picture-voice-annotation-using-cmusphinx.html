<p>It's great that more and more applications are using CMUSphinx. Recently a smart picture voice-annotation/tagging Android app using speech recognition to automatically generate multiple suggestion has been announced. Smile uses CMU Sphinx4 as one of the ASR recognizers.</p>
<p>Smile is a camera and picture gallery application that helps you to immediately voice-annotate your photos. Smile will then automatically extract the text (annotation) from the recorded voice using speech recognition technology, and will embed the text annotation and the voice as metadata inside the picture. So if you are searching for a picture in the hundreds of pictures you have on your phone, you can find them easily using Smile's Search facility. Even more, with Smile you can share the photo with friends, with or without the speech and text. Your friends or colleagues can see the picture (if they don't have Smile), and with Smile they can see the picture, the text and listen to the speech. Great for fun, quick greeting photos, work if you need to take photos with record to cherish memories, for documentation purposes, expense receipts, and many more uses.</p>
<p>To play with Smile you can download it at <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.neuromorphic.retinet.smile">Google Play Store</a>.</p>
