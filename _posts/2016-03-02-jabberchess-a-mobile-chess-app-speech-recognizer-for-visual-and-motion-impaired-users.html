<p><a href="http://chenjackson.com">Jackson Chen</a>, a high-schooler from Colorado, US has recently made available a chess application controlled by voice created with CMUSphinx. You can <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/en/app/jabberchess/id106071445?mt=8">find it in AppStore</a>.</p>
<p>It is a very interesting case of CMUSphinx used in real-life application also because Jackson has created complete report of his experience creating the chess application and shared the models he created in the process. He performed a huge work on testing the application in real-life. He compared the performance of CMUSphinx grammars, language models and he also explored recognition with commercial engine from Nuance. You could easy guess which engine provided the best accuracy, if you want to learn more, please check the <a href="https://cmusphinx.github.io/data/chess/ExtendedEssay.pdf">full report</a>. You can find the models <a href="https://cmusphinx.github.io/data/chess/chessmodel.tar.gz">here</a>.</p>
<p>If you have created your application with CMUSphinx, please let us know!</p>
