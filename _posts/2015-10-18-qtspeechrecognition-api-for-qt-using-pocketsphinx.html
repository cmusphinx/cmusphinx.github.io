It is really great to see the wide variety of APIs raising around Pocketsphinx, one recent new one is QtSpeechRecognition API implemented by <a href="http://www.code-q.fi/en/">Code-Q</a> for assistive applications. This undertaking is quite ambitious, the main features include</p>
<ul>
<li>Speech recognition engines are loaded as plug-ins.</li>
<li>Engine is controlled asynchronously, causing only minimal load to the<br />
application thread.</li>
<li>Built-in task queue makes plug-in development easier and forces<br />
unified behavior between engine integrations.</li>
<li>Engine integration handles the audio recording, making it easy to use<br />
from the application.</li>
<li>Application can create multiple grammars and switch between them.</li>
<li>Setting mute temporarily disables speech recognition, allowing<br />
co-operation with audio output (speech prompts or audio cues).</li>
<li>Includes integration to PocketSphinx engine (latest codebase) as a<br />
reference.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can discuss features and find more details on the following <a href="http://lists.qt-project.org/pipermail/development/2015-September/023034.html">thread</a> in Qt mailing list. You can find the sources in review in qtspeech project, branch&nbsp;<a href="https://codereview.qt-project.org/#/q/project:qt/qtspeech+branch:wip/speech-recognition,n,z">wip/speech-recognition</a>.</p>
<p>The implementation already includes pretty interesting features, for example it intelligently saves and restores CMN state for more robust recognition. So let us see how it goes.</p>
