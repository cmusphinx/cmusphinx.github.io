<p>Here comes the first update on the <strong>Long Audio Training</strong> project. It's aim is to enable SphinxTrain training on recordings hours long. Presently the SphinxTrain can process files up to 3 minutes approx.</p>
<p>Full info on the project can be found at <a title="https://cmusphinx.github.io/wiki/longaudiotraining" href="https://cmusphinx.github.io/wiki/longaudiotraining">https://cmusphinx.github.io/wiki/longaudiotraining</a>.</p>
<p>During the last week a collection of audio files 5 to 10 minutes long have been turned into  CMUSphinx training database in order to determine possible issues when  training on longer recordings. The first experiments resulted in two main findings:</p>
<ul>
<li>Some of the components of SphinxTrain put an arbitrary limit to the size of data they process. E.g. the problem is with the function <em>read_line</em> which reads a line only up to the constant size of a buffer. This implementation resulted in crashes of training process in the baum-welch step due to the failed word lookup.</li>
<li>Another finding is that the training process currently requires a huge amout of memory. This takes about 1.7GB of RAM when trainning on ~5 minutes-long recording and much over 4GB processing ~10 minutes-long input. (I did not determine the actual value because this actually shot down my machine.) This indicates there is a flaw in the memory management of the training process and will be subject to examination in the following days.</li>
</ul>
<p>A branch <strong>long-audio-training</strong> was created in the CMUSphinx SVN repository. All work done on this project will be commited into this branch.</p>
<p>First change is the fix for the word-lookup problem which was caused by the truncation of transcription sentence and thus it's last word. The idea is to replace all usages of <em>read_line</em> in SphinxTrain with the <em>lineiter_*</em> set of functions from <em>sphinxbase</em>, which do not impose any such limits on the length of the data.</p>
<p>More update to come soon, stay tuned!</p>
