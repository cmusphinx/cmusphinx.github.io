<p>Microsoft traditionally has very good speech recognition technology. Recently announced speech recognition assistant Cortana is one of the best available assistant. However, it might lack support for your native language or just behave not the way you expect (hey, Siri also still doesn't support many languages).</p>
<p>Thanks to a wonderful work by <a href="http://nl.linkedin.com/in/toinedeboer">Toine de Boer</a> you can now enjoy Pocketsphinx on Windows phone platform. It is as straightforward as on Android, you can just download the project from our github <a href="http://github.com/cmusphinx/pocketsphinx-wp-demo">http://github.com/cmusphinx/pocketsphinx-wp-demo</a>, import it into your Visual Studio and run on the phone. You can enjoy all the features of CMUSphinx on Windows phone: continuous hands-free operation, switchable grammars, support for custom acoustic and language models. There is no need to wait for the speech recognition input in the game. We hope this opens the possibilities for new great applications.</p>
<p>The demo includes continuous listening for the keyphrase "oh mighty computer" and once keyphrase is detected it switches to grammar mode to let you input some information. Let us know how it works.</p>
