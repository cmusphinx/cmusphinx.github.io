<p>It's interesting that CMUSphinx gives the developers all over the world the ability to build speech systems, interact with voice and build something unique and useful</p>
<p><object width="480" height="385"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/fQ59dXOo63o?fs=1&amp;hl=ru_RU"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/fQ59dXOo63o?fs=1&amp;hl=ru_RU" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="480" height="385"></embed></object></p>
<p>This Kinect imitation is not really very impressive or complicated speech recognition, it's all about freedom of creativity. If you want to build interactive application, just write few lines of code and it will work. In many languages, for many people.</p>
<p>And we'll be satisfied as well.</p>
