<p>Sourceforge done some wrong steps, but now is is getting definitely better. And they provide a crazy slow, but still a very valuable hosting for us.</p>
<p>Nice thing is that CMUSphinx has been selected of the <a href="https://sourceforge.net/blog/projects-of-the-week-june-6-2016/">project of this week</a>. Congratulations to the team!</p>
<p>As a bonus, we have uploaded a new <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/cmusphinx/files/G2P%20Models/">G2P Seq2Seq</a> model and added an <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/cmusphinx/files/Acoustic%20and%20Language%20Models/Italian/">acoustic model</a> to for one of the most beautiful languages in the world, Italian! </p>
