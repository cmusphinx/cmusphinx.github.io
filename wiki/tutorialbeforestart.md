# Before you start

Before you start the development of the speech application, you need to
consider several important points. They will define the way you'll
implement the application.

##  Algorithms

Speech technology puts several important limits on the way it's possible
to implement the application. For example, as noted above it is

**impossible** to recognize any known word of the language. You need
to consider the ways to overcome such limitations. Such ways are known 
for most types of applications out there and described later in
tutorial. To follow them, you sometimes need to rethink how your
application will behave and interact with the user.

Although we try to provide important examples, we obviously can't cover
everything. There is no utterance verification or speaker identification
example yet, though they could be created later. Most algorithms are widely 
covered in scientific literature, and some of them are explained in tutorial 
later in the section. Moreover, new methods to solve old problems raise each 
year.

To name several common applications and the way to approach them:

**Generic dictation** is never so generic. You need to find out a domain
you'll recognize which can be dialogs, readings, meetings, voicemails,
legal or medical  transcriptions. If you consider voicemails, note that
the language there is way more restricted than general language. It's
actually a very small vocabulary with specialized sequence of terms:


*  *It's Sandy. Let's meet tomorrow*

*  *Hi. That's Joe, I'm going to sell you that car*

There will be a lot of names and that's a problem, but you'll never find
a voicemail about quantum physics and that's a very good thing.
The recognizer will use the restrictions you provided with the language
model to improve accuracy of the result.

You'll have to build a language model for your domain, but that's not as
complicated as you might think. Don't afraid as well, if you'll cover the
60k most common words in English; the accuracy will be the same as with 
120k words. For other languages with rich morphology the situation is
different, but also solvable with morphology-based subwords. Also, you
have to build a  post-processing system, adaptation system and
user-identification system.

For **recognition on an embedded processor,** there are two ways to consider
- recognition on the server and recognition on the device. The former is
more popular now days because it lets you use the power and flexibility of
the cloud computations.

**Language learning** will require you to build a framework for tracking
incorrect pronunciations. That will include generation of incorrect
pronunciations and scoring them.

For **command and control,** it was popular to use a finite state grammar for a
long time. Unfortunately, we could not recommend that to you now days. It's
way better to employ a medium vocabulary recognizer with semantic analysis
framework on the top to improve user experience and let him use more or
less natural language. In short, don't build command and control, build intelligent assistants instead.

For **intelligent assistants** you need not just the recognition, but also intent parsing and database knowledge. For more detail on how to implement this you can check [ Lucida ](https///github.com/claritylab/ ) powered by [OpenEphyra](https///github.com/TScottJ/OpenEphyra). Dialog systems will require user feedback framework as well.

**Voice search, semantic analysis and translation** will need to be build on
the top of the lattices generated by engine. You need to take lattices
with confidence scores and feed them into the upper levels like
translation engine.

For open vocabulary recognition like **name and places recognition,** you
will need a subword language model.

**Text alignment,** like captions synchronization, will require you to build
a specialized language model from reference text to restrict the search.

## Existing accuracy figures

For most tasks above there are published accuracy results. You can find
them if you'll identify the task. Those results could be useful
or not useful in terms of accuracy for your users. You might count
that you'll jump over the figures, but it's unlikely that it will be done
quickly.

For example, the broadcast news recognition task is done with 20-25%
accuracy. If it's not enough for your application, you probably need to
consider modification of the application. You might add hand-correction
step or preliminary adaptation step to improve accuracy. If accuracy
will not be sufficient after that, probably it's better to think if you
need speech at all. There are other more reliable interfaces you could
use. 

For example, though ASR-based IVR systems are fancy and handy, many
people still prefer communication with DTMF systems or web-based forms
or just email to contact the company. Remember that you need an
effective interface, not modest one.

## Resources

Next issue you need to consider, is the availability of the speech
material for training, testing and optimizing the system. You need to
find out which resources are available to you.

The **testing set** is a critical issue for any speech recognition
application. The testing set should be representative enough
acoustically and terms of language. But the test set shouldn't necessary
be large, you can spend 10 minutes to create a good one. It might be a
sample recordings you could do yourself.

For training set and models you should check the resources that are
already present. The increasing interest in speech technology makes
people  contribute by creation of models for their native languages. In
general, you'll have to collect audio material for specified language.
Actually it's not so complicated thing to do. Audio books, movies and
podcasts provide enough recordings to build very good acoustic model
with little effort.

To build a phonetic dictionary you can use existing TTS synthesizer
which nowdays cover a lot of languages. Also you can boostrap dictionary
by hand and then extend it with machine learning tools.

For language models you'll have to find a lot of texts for your domain.
It might be textbooks, already transcribed recordings or some other
sources like website contents crawled on the web.

## Technologies

Third thing to consider is the set of particular technologies you will 
build on. Although CMUSphinx tries to provide more or less complete 
program suite for development of speech applications, you'll sometimes
need to use other packages/programming languages/tools. You need to find
out yourself if you are going to continue with Java, C or any of
scripting languages CMUSphinx supports. The rule to choose between 
sphinx4 or pocketsphinx is the following:


*  Need speed or portability -> use pocketsphinx

*  Need flexibility and managability -> use sphinx4

Although people often ask what is more accurate sphinx4 or pocketsphinx,
you shouldn't bother with this question at all. Accuracy is **not** the
argument here. Both sphinx4 and pocketsphinx provide acceptable accuracy
and even then it depends on many factors, not just the engine. The thing
is that engine is just a part of the system which should include many
more components. If we are talking about large vocabulary decoder, there
must be diarization framework, adaptation framework and postprocessing
framework. They all need to cooperate somehow. Flexibility of sphinx4
allows you to build such a system quickly. It's easy to embed sphinx4
into flash server like red5 to provide web-based recognition, it's easy
to manage many sphinx4 instances doing large-scale decoding on a
cluster.

On the other side, if your system needs to be efficient and reasonably
accurate, if you are running on embedded device or you are interested in
using recognizer with some exotic language like Erlang, pocketsphinx is
your choice. It's very hard to integrate Java with other languages not
supported by JVM pocketsphinx is way better here.

Next example of what you need to consider a development platform choice.
If you are bound to some, that's an easy question for you. If you can
choose, we highly recommend you to use GNU/Linux as  a development
platform. We can help you with Windows or Mac issues but there are no
guarantees, our main development platform is Linux. For many tasks
you'll need to run complex scripts using perl of python. On Windows it
might be problematic.

Got it? Let's start! Next section will describe the process of creation
the sample application either with [ sphinx4](tuturialsphinx4 ) or [ pocketsphinx](tutorialpocketsphinx ). 
Choose the right one.
