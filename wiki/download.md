# CMU Sphinx Downloads
## Software

CMU Sphinx toolkit has a number of packages for different tasks and 
applications. It's sometimes confusing what to choose. To cleanup, here is the 
list

  * Pocketsphinx — recognizer library written in C.
  * Sphinxtrain — acoustic model training tools
  * Sphinxbase — support library required by Pocketsphinx and Sphinxtrain
  * Sphinx4 — adjustable, modifiable recognizer written in Java

We recommend you to use the latest available releases:

  * 
[sphinxbase-5prealpha](http://sourceforge.net/projects/cmusphinx/files/sphinxbase/5prealpha)
  * 
[pocketsphinx-5prealpha](http://sourceforge.net/projects/cmusphinx/files/pocketsphinx/5prealpha)
  * 
[sphinxtrain-5prealpha](http://sourceforge.net/projects/cmusphinx/files/sphinxtrain/5prealpha)
  * 
[sphinx4-5prealpha](http://sourceforge.net/projects/cmusphinx/files/sphinx4/5prealpha)

If you want to try bleeding edge version, pull the latest code from
Github. Then compile packages from the source code, but remember that
there is no guarantee they will be stable.

Older releases and files could be found on SourceForge

We do not maintain distribution-specific packages yet, but help to update them 
is truely appreciated. Some distributions already include CMUSphinx packages:


## Models

CMUSphinx assumes that you use the statistical models which describe language. 
There are many models trained
for various acoustic conditions and various performance requirements. We 
collect the best models
available at our download page. We hope you'll be able to find the best model 
for your language there:

[Download models](https://sourceforge.net/projects/cmusphinx/files/Acoustic%20and%20Language%20Models/)

We are also planning to use bittorrent tracker to distribute the models
but we are not there yet, if you are willing to help, please [contact us](mailto:cmusphinx-devel@lists.sourceforge.net)
