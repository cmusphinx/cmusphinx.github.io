## Integrating CMUSphinx with Telephony Servers - Asterisk and Freeswitch

Pocketsphinx and Asterisk integration is as simple as it never was! Just use 
MRCP server. There are two of them:

[ UniMRCP](http://www.unimrcp.org/ ) (pocketsphinx)

[Cairo](http://www.speechforge.org/projects/cairo/ ) (sphinx4)

Same is true for Freeswitch, just use MRCP protocol and MRCP server.
