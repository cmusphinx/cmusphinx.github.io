# Overview of CMUSphinx toolkit

CMUSphinx toolkit is a leading speech recognition toolkit with various tools 
used to build speech applications. CMU Sphinx toolkit has a number of packages 
for different tasks and applications. It’s sometimes confusing what to choose. 
To cleanup, here is the list:

* Pocketsphinx — lightweight recognizer library written in C.
* Sphinxbase — support library required by Pocketsphinx
* Sphinx4 — adjustable, modifiable recognizer written in Java
* Sphinxtrain — acoustic model training tools

We recommend that you use the latest available releases:

* [sphinxbase-5prealpha](https://sourceforge.net/projects/cmusphinx/files/sphinxbase/5prealpha)
* [pocketsphinx-5prealpha](https://sourceforge.net/projects/cmusphinx/files/pocketsphinx/5prealpha)
* [sphinx4-5prealpha](https://sourceforge.net/projects/cmusphinx/files/sphinx4/5prealpha)
* [sphinxtrain-5prealpha](https://sourceforge.net/projects/cmusphinx/files/sphinxtrain/5prealpha/)

Of course, many things are missing. Things like building a phonetic
model capable of handling an infinite vocabulary, postprocessing of the
decoding result, sense extraction and other semantic tools should be
added one day. Probably you should take it on.
