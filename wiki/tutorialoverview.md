# Overview of CMUSphinx toolkit

CMUSphinx toolkit is a leading speech recognition toolkit with various tools used to build speech applications. CMU Sphinx toolkit has a number of packages for different tasks and applications. It’s sometimes confusing what to choose. To cleanup, here is the list:

*  Pocketsphinx — lightweight recognizer library written in C.
*  Sphinxbase — support library required by Pocketsphinx
*  Sphinx4 — adjustable, modifiable recognizer written in Java
*  Sphinxtrain — acoustic model training tools


We recommend that you use the latest available releases:

*  [ sphinxbase-5prealpha](https://sourceforge.net/projects/cmusphinx/files/sphinxbase/5prealpha)
*  [ pocketsphinx-5prealpha](https://sourceforge.net/projects/cmusphinx/files/pocketsphinx/5prealpha )
*  [ sphinx4-5prealpha](https://sourceforge.net/projects/cmusphinx/files/sphinx4/5prealpha )
*  [ sphinxtrain-5prealpha](https://sourceforge.net/projects/cmusphinx/files/sphinxtrain/5prealpha/ )

Of course, many things are missing. Things like building a phonetic model capable of handling an infinite vocabulary, postprocessing of the decoding result, sense extraction and other semantic tools should be added one day. Probably you should take it on.
