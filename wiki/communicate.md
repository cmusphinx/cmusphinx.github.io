Do you have trouble and need help or you've got a wonderful idea? We are willing to help.

### Read the HOWTO on asking proper questions

Here is the good one [How to Ask Questions in Smart Way](http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html ). Please 
understand that to save **your** time it's better to provide as much information as you can. The optimal way 
is to provide a short example that we can run ourselves. Do not just tell that the program gives errors, instead, share complete error log, text and audio files needed to reproduce your error.
