Language model describes possible word sequencies. A good introduction to the language modelling things and challenges beside the conventional literature are the following surveys:

[ Two decades of statistical language modeling: Where do we go from here by Ronald Rosenfeld](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.140.5518 )

[ A Bit of Progress in Language Modeling (2001) by Joshua T. Goodman](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.23.892 )

A lastest trend is discriminative language models and recurrent neural-network language models

They demonstrate a good performance and a lot of interest is devoted to them.
