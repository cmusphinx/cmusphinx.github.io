# CMUSphinx Documentation


This page contains collaboratively developed documentation for the CMU Sphinx 
speech recognition engines.

## Beginner User Documentation

This section contains links to documents which describe how to use Sphinx to 
recognize speech. 
Currently, we have very little in the way of end-user tools, so it may be a bit 
sparse for the 
forseeable future.


*  [Tutorial](Tutorial): Getting started with CMUSphinx for developers
     * [ Basic concepts of speech](tutorialconcepts )
     * [ Overview of the CMUSphinx toolkit](tutorialoverview )
     * [ Before you start](tutorialbeforestart )
     * [ Building application using pocketsphinx](tutorialpocketsphinx)
     * [ Building application using sphinx4](tutorialsphinx4)
     * [ Using pocketsphinx on Android](tutorialandroid )
     * [ Building language models](tutoriallm)
     * [ Adapting existing acoustic model](tutorialadapt )
     * [ Building the acoustic model](tutorialam )
     * [ Building a dictionary](tutorialdict)
     * [ Debugging speech recognition accuracy](tutorialtuning )

evaluation](pocketsphinx_pronunciation_evaluation )

in detail, or they serve as a
developer's guide to accomplishing some particular task.
